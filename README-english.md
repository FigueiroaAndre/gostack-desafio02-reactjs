# Bootcamp GoStack - Challenge 02
This repository has my solution of the second challenge from the GoStack bootcamp promoted by Rocketseat. This time I have to create a simple frontend with ReactJS that consumes the API built in the [first challenge](https://github.com/FigueiroaAndre/gostack-desafio01-nodejs)

## Run the application
Follow the instructions to run the backend from the first challenge, then you can run these commands (in this project's folder):
```SHELL
yarn # or npm install
yarn dev # or npm run dev
```

## Testing
Instructions to run the automated tests:
```SHELL
yarn test # or npm run tests
```
